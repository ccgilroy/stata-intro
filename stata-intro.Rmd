# What is Stata?

<br>

.font140[
- a software package for statistics

- primarily based on typed commands

- proprietary (i.e. not free), with corporate support

- extensible with community add-ons
]

# Statistical programming

Statistical software exists on a continuum: 

.pull-left.center[
More "point-and-click":

Excel  
Tableau  
SPSS  
SAS  
...

]

.pull-right.center[
Programming languages:

R  
Python  
...

]

.center.font150[Stata falls in the middle]

<br>
You could use it like a point-and-click program ... but you shouldn't. Instead, write scripts with all of your commands in a "do-file."

Why? This produces a **clear, reproducible record** of your research.

# Challenges

<br>

.font140[
**The learning curve can be steep**  
This may not be how you're used to interacting with a computer. Trust that you'll build confidence and good coding habits with time!

**Syntax and spelling count!**  
Computers aren't humans, and they'll do exactly what you tell them to ... even if that isn't what you really want
]

(A quirk: Stata commands can be *abbreviated*. There are some conventional abbreviations, but remember that you're writing code that you want humans to be able to read.)

# Tasks in statistical analysis

.font120[Let's think abstractly about common tasks we'll need to do]

For instance:

--

- get data into the programming environment

--

- modify variables or create new ones, filter rows of observations

--

- look at variables and calculate descriptive statistics

--

- calculate inferential statistics

--

- visualize variables and models

--

- save output

# Stata syntax

<br><br><br><br>

All Stata statements have the same format:

.font150[
```
command [varlist] [maybe some other stuff] [, options]
```
]

(I'm leaving a few things outâ€”you can see the rest [here](https://geocenter.github.io/StataTraining/pdf/StataCheatsheet_processing_15_June_2016_TE-REV.pdf) if you're curious)

# Basic commands

### Load data

Load a .dta file with `use`: 

```stata
use "directory/filename"
```

(For built-in data sets, the command is `sysuse` instead)

### Create variables

Create new variables with `generate` (for fancy extensions, use `egen`):

```stata
gen x=0
gen logGDPPerCapita = ln(GDP/Population)
```

To overwrite a variable, instead use `replace`: 

```stata
replace x=5
replace male = 1 if gender == 2
```
---
# Basic commands

### Filter observations

Filter with `if` (note the double equals sign!)

```stata
replace y = 2 if x == 1
```

You can do this with regressions to model a subset of data:

```stata
reg salary jobhrs educ, if male == 1
```

---

# Basic commands

### Descriptives

Descriptive statistics with `summarize`: 

```stata
sum age educ maritalstatus
```

Frequency tables or crosstabs with `tabulate`: 

```stata
tab educ
tab educ sex
```

### Regression

Bivariate or multivariate regression with `regress`: 

```stata
reg depvar indep1 indep2 indep3 
reg salary jobhrs educ
```

---
# Basic commands

### Visualization

```stata
graph pie, over(maritalstatus)
```

```stata
twoway scatter salary jobhrs
```

### Export

```stata
graph save file_name
```

# Advice

.font120[
**Use a `fixed-width` (`monospace`) font** to format code and output in your homework (Courier New is one option in Word)

**Get access to a remote environment** like the CSDE server

**Get comfortable making mistakes** and troubleshooting errors!  
You have many resources for solving problems as they come up: 

- built-in documentation with `help`, e.g. `help regress`
- Google and Stack Overflow
- each other, the TA, and the professor

# Let's do it!

<br><br><br><br>

.font140[
Go to "Modules" on the Canvas course page and download `new_FIRST_SESSION_504.do` from the "Stata stuff" module.

We'll open Stata and review it together.
